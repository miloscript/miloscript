### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I code stuff. I'll complete this README one day. But until then, it's just a placeholder.

In case I haven't finished it yet, since I'm programming all day on a real job, here's an AI poem about this README.

```
In the realm of code, a tale untold,
README.MD, incomplete, heart so cold.
Lines left hanging, dreams left adrift,
A melancholic void, a poignant rift.

Unfinished words, a silent plea,
Lost in the digital expanse, endlessly.
A README yearning for finality's grace,
To find its purpose, to claim its place.

But fret not, dear reader, for here we unite,
To breathe life into the narrative's plight.
With every keystroke, we shall revive,
A README complete, vibrant and alive.

Together we'll craft, a tale to be seen,
Transforming the sadness into a hopeful gleam.
Let's embark on this journey, hand in hand,
Resurrecting the README, a story unplanned.
```
